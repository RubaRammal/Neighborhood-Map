## Neighborhood Map project

This project is part of Udacity's frontend nanodegree. The goal is to create a map that have several locations and a search field to filter the locations.

### Getting started

* Click [here](https://rubarammal.github.io/Neighborhood-Map/) to visit the Caf√© Locator website. Or clone the project and open `index.html`.
* Locations on the map can be filtered using the search field on the sidebar.
* Clicking a marker on the map opens a window that displays the location's name and a photo from that location.
* The hamburger icon on the top bar hides and shows the sidebar that contains the locations' list.

### Dependencies

__This project uses the following APIs:__

1. [Google Maps APIs](https://developers.google.com/maps/) 
This API is used to load a map, create markers of locations on the map and opens an infoWindow that displays location details when a marker is clicked.
1. [Foursquare Places API](https://developer.foursquare.com/places-api)
This API is used to get venues near a specific location and it is also used to get photos of these venues.
